## Covid Map

An animated map using Vega showing the spread of Covid-19 across the UK using data from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/.

Topojson can be a bit tricky to get working in the certified Deneb visual (no loading from external sources) but the .pbix below shows this can be done by embedding the topojson inline.

## Pancake Spider Chart

A faceted spider chart which was my submission to a competition using a BBC Good Food pancake recipe dataset and built with Deneb, Vega and PowerBI. In Vega, each axis can have its own scale which is essential for comparing different dimensions. 

I won ðŸ˜Š.
